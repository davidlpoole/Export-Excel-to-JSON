# Export-Excel-to-JSON
VBA script to export a table from Excel to JSON


## Usage Instructions:

Clone the file from this repo ("Excel to JSON.xlsm")
This file contains the VBA script and a button to run the script.

Replace the example data with your own, however many columns and
rows as you require. Then click the button and the file will be 
output to the same folder as the "Excel to JSON.xlsm" file.

Filename, folder, etc can be changed within the script.


## Alternative method

Copy the code only version ("ExcelToJSON.bas") into your your own
spreadsheet, make sure your spreadsheet is saved where you want 
the output to go. (Also it will error if the file is not saved at
all... TODO: handle error)
